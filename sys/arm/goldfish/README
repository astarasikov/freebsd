What is Goldfish Board?
	It is a virtual ARM board provided by the Android Emulator.

What do I need to keep in mind when developing?
	I have literally spent more than a month hunting down various MMU bugs
	that prevented FreeBSD from booting successfully on a Goldfish board.

	Turned out, Android Emulator's support for ARM1136 CPU lacked C13 CP15
	register used for TLS and PCPU. Emulating TLS via a
	memory page at 0xffff0000 did not help much. Anyway, the emulator
	supports emulating an ARMv7-compatible Cortex A8.

	I have not tracked down the exact difference in MMU management between
	Linux and FreeBSD that caused random memory corruption on Goldfish. However,
	it is known that FreeBSD works on QEMU with VERSATILEPB board. Unfortunately
	the versions of Android Emulator from the SDK are based on an ancient QEMU
	version that probably had some bug. Luckily, since Android-L preview release,
	Google publishes prebuilt versions of Android Emulator from the latest source
	code that do not have that bug. Please use the following the
	"l-preview" branch from the following git repository:
	https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/android-emulator

I can't find Android Emulator for FreeBSD!
	Linux binaries work fine provided that you mount linprocfs at /proc
	and install linux libraries (for example, linux_base-f10) including GTK.
	Unfortunately it looks like prebuilt nightlies are 64-bit only
	so you should try building one for FreeBSD natively.

	>> git clone https://github.com/astarasikov/qemu.git
	>> https://github.com/astarasikov/android_external_gtest
	>> cd cd android_external_gtest
	>> git checkout cm-11.0
	>> cd ../qemu.git
	>> git checkout l-preview-freebsd
	>> bash android-build-freebsd.sh

How to run?
	Install Android SDK and create an Android Virtual Device with
	an ARMv7 CPU (for example, Nexus 4) and 512MB RAM and sd card.

	Then, copy Raspberry PI SD card image to
	~/.android/avd/FreeBSD/sdcard.img

	You are also advised to adjust SD card size in AVD settings
	or sdcard.size in ~/.android/avd/FreeBSD/config.ini

	>> emulator-arm -shell-serial stdio -show-kernel \
	>> -shell -avd FreeBSD  -kernel ~/bsd/flash \
	>> -qemu -hda ~/.android/avd/FreeBSD.avd/sdcard.img \
	>> -cpu cortex-a8

	(Actually, -hda and -cpu can be ommited if you configure them in
	AVD settings)

How to package the kernel?
	The same way it is done for VERSATILEPB board

	>> export KERN=/usr/obj/arm.armv6/usr/src/sys/GOLDFISH/kernel.bin

	>> rm ./header ./flash

	>> /usr/bin/printf "\0\0\240\343" > header
	>> /usr/bin/printf "\0\020\240\343" >> header
	>> /usr/bin/printf "\0\040\240\343" >> header
	>> /usr/bin/printf "\0\060\240\343" >> header
	>> /usr/bin/printf "\001\366\240\343" >> header

	>> dd of=flash bs=1M count=4 if=/dev/zero
	>> dd of=flash bs=1 conv=notrunc if=header
	>> dd of=flash bs=64k oseek=15 conv=notrunc if=$KERN
